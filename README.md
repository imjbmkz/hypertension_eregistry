## Hypertension e-Registry
Excel-based hypertensive patient tracking, monitoring, and reporting system

### About this document
This document contains (1) the workflow that discusses how the Hypertension e-Registry is used on the users' level, and (2) the technical aspects, such as the functions and sub-procedures used, and the worksheet dependencies.

### Description of this project
The **Hypertension e-Registry** (simply *e-Registry*) is an Excel-based system that is used to track hypertensive patients, monitor their monthly visits, and extract reports containing statistics and indicators relevant to hypertension. This is intended to be used at the municipality level (eg. RHU). The e-Registry has two primary sections: (1) **Patient Registry** and (2) **Reports**. The following are the tasks that each section can do.

**Patient Registry**
- Search existing patient records
- Update patient details
- Add visit details (blood pressure, medications)
- Drop patients
- Enroll new patients

**Reports**
- Generate annual and quarterly statistics (counts and percentages)
- Generate defined indicators
- Generate quarterly list of defaulters
- Generate quarterly count of current medications
- Download patient masterlist

The e-Registry can only be used by one person at a time to ensure that the data are up to date, and are not scattered to different Excel files.
